Project Name: Color Vision

Project Description:
Color Vision is a web application designed to test color perception and identify color blindness in users. The application presents users with a series of images containing colored numbers or patterns, which may be difficult for individuals with color vision deficiencies to discern. Users are prompted to input the numbers or patterns they see in each image. The application then evaluates the user's responses to determine their color perception accuracy and potential color blindness.

Features:

Color Blindness Test: Users can take a color blindness test by viewing a series of images containing colored numbers or patterns and inputting their responses.
Randomized Image Selection: The test randomly selects a subset of images from a pool of available images for each test session, ensuring variety and unpredictability.
Scoring System: Users receive a score based on the number of correct responses given during the test.
Result Page: After completing the test, users are directed to a result page that displays their score, as well as the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and unattempted questions.
Feedback and Recommendations: Based on the user's score, the application provides feedback and recommendations. For example, if the user's score indicates potential color blindness, they may be advised to consult an eye care professional for further evaluation.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.
CSS: Styling language for designing the appearance of the web pages.
Bootstrap: Front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites, used for creating the navbar and footer sections.
JavaScript: Programming language for implementing interactive features, such as the color blindness test functionality and score calculation.
Font Awesome: Icon library used for adding social media icons and other graphical elements to the website.
Project Goals:

Provide an accessible and user-friendly platform for testing color perception and identifying color blindness.
Raise awareness about color vision deficiencies and their impact on daily life and activities.
Offer guidance and recommendations for individuals with color vision deficiencies to seek appropriate assistance and support.
Overall, the Color Vision project aims to promote visual health and inclusivity by offering a simple yet effective tool for assessing color vision and facilitating early detection of color blindness.
